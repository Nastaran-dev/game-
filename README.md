I made a simple but challenging mini-game with JavaScript, and Tailwind 🎮

In this game, the user has to control a basket, collect ice creams 🍦 and avoid colliding with bombs 💣.

✅ Includes a live scoring system (Live Score)

✅ Sound effects for victory and defeat 🔊

✅ Interactive and responsive design for a better browser experience

This project was a great exercise in working with event handling, collision detection, and DOM manipulation.
